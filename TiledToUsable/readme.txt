To use this converter:
1. Instal program Tiled
2. Create new tileset (if using my tilesets set tilesize to 72px and margin to 0px)
3. Create new map and use your freshly created tileset
4. Place all tiles that are supposed to be solid in one row, on one layer
5. Go to map->map properties and uncheck the infinity box
6. Select map->autocrop
7. Export as config.csv and place in folder Project7
8. Create new map using same tileset
4. Get creative ;) If working on RPG project it is recommended to use maximum 3 layers, and to place ALL objects that are supposed to be drawn over the player on the third layer. When creating layers DO NOT change their names.
9. Uncheck infinity and autocrop
7. Export created map to .csv type and place in the same folder as your config file
11. Run TilesToUsable
12. When asked for filename give only the first part, ommiting the layer name etc.
